    "## Interpretation and answers to the prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are suggested / example interpretations you should update after you `Run All` cells and inspect the exact values/plots produced by the cells above.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Which features seem to drive the model's decision to grant a loan?\n",
    "- Credit score and income group typically show the strongest relationship with `loan_status`: higher credit buckets and higher income quartiles generally have higher approval rates.\n",
    "- Previous loan defaults almost always strongly decrease approval rate (an important driver).\n",
    "- Employment experience often helps (more experience → slightly higher approval) but is usually less powerful than credit and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Which features seem unrelated?\n",
    "- Age group often shows some variation but usually much smaller than credit/income. If gender differences appear, they may be due to correlation with other features (e.g., income or employment) rather than a causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Should the financial institution be concerned about potential legal trouble?\n",
    "- If `person_gender` independently predicts approval after controlling for credit score and income (i.e., there is a gender gap in approval rates even among similar credit/income buckets), then yes — the institution should be concerned about potential discrimination. Visual checks above (gender hue plots) will show whether differences persist after grouping by key legitimate factors.\n",
    "- Note: correlation isn't proof of illegal discrimination — but it is evidence that requires further investigation with controlled models. If gender remains a strong predictor in multivariate models, legal risk could be real.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) How to justify these conclusions to the court (brief):\n",
    "- Point to the bar charts showing high approval rates for high `credit_group` and `income_group` and very low approval for those with `previous_default`.\n",
    "- Show numeric correlations for confirmation, and if needed run a controlled logistic regression as next step to quantify the independent effect of `person_gender` while controlling for credit and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final steps for submission\n",
    "- Run all cells so outputs and plots are visible.\n",
    "- Add any short commentary you want to include (for example cite the numeric rates from the output and mention any passengers or cases you investigated).\n",
    "- Save and commit the file, then push to GitHub and submit the repository link per your course instructions.\n"
