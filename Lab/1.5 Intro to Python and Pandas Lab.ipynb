    "\n",
    "Five questions I will answer in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which clan has the highest average power? (use groupby + mean)\n",
    "2. How many cards are in each grade? (use value_counts)\n",
    "3. What is the distribution of card rarities? (use value_counts)\n",
    "4. On average, do grade 1 or grade 2 cards provide higher shields? (compare means)\n",
    "5. Which card has the highest power-to-grade ratio (power divided by grade)?\n",
